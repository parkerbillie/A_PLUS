How to get acquired skills
Here are eight steps you can take to learn acquired skills:

</p>
<p>
		<h6><li>Learn which skills are valuable</h6>
Before developing a certain skill, verify its value in your particular industry. For instance, if you work in the medical field and are thinking about working on your communication skills, research to see if communication is a needed skill in your job. This can ensure you spend your time learning something that helps you with your position. To find relevant skills, read job descriptions for positions similar to yours or ask your manager to see what skills employers are seeking in candidates.

</li>
</p>
<p>

<h6><li> Set some goals for yourself</h6>
Once you select what skill you would like to develop, set a goal. Try to relate this to your career goals by thinking about what sort of position you want in the future and what skills you need to succeed. To help make your acquisition more manageable, break up your overall goal into smaller ones. You can begin by learning entry-level components of the skill, then learning more advanced ones.

</li>
</p>
<p>
<h6><li>Choose the correct training</h6>
Reflect on how you learn when choosing the right training. Knowing how you learn best and matching a training program to your learning style can help you be more efficient. For instance, if you are an auditory learner, consider taking an online course with a professor instructing you through a series of lectures.
</li>
</p>
<p>
 <h6><li>Create time to work on skill</h6>
In order to build your skill, set aside some time to dedicate to your development and invest in yourself. Try to create a regular schedule to help you complete your work and commit to your learning. When scheduling times to work on your skills, think about times you are most productive so you can get the most out of your time.

</li>
</p>
<p>
 <h6><li>Find a mentor to work with</h6>
Seek a more experienced employee in your organization to help share their knowledge with you. See if they have any tips or tricks to help you improve. A mentor can also share their experiences with you and recommend practices to avoid. They may even help you overcome challenges that arose while working on your skill.
</li>
</p>
<p>
<h6><li>Add more responsibilities</h6>
To apply your acquired skills, ask your manager for more work or propose a project that uses your new abilities. Another way to do this is by finding a problem to solve in your organization. For instance, if you notice you can improve the workflow at your employer, work on developing new software using the coding language you are learning.

<h6><li>Consider skill sharing</h6>
To learn a skill valuable in your field, collaborate with someone who has experience in the industry. Someone who has your desired skill can teach you how to become an expert in it in exchange for you to teach them a skill. This exchange of skills can help you both grow and have a positive impact on the organization overall.<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR-gKCewzbBcpLV4WcQzBTpijMgICiBQNoYl8S23H9oWbXjSiNS-XpNPhdwXg&s">

</p></li>
<p>
<h6><li>Solicit regular feedback</h6>
Get regular feedback to help you reflect on how you are doing. This may involve asking a coworker or manager to evaluate your progress to provide an outsider's perspective. You can also perform a self-evaluation of your performance to determine what is going well and where you have areas for improvement.
